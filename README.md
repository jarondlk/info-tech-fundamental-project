## Introduction

**Objectives**: To benchmark and compare the performance of various deep learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), on plankton classification tasks.

**Goals**: Identify the most effective architecture for accurately classifying plankton species.

## EDA, Data Cleaning and Data Preparation

### Obtaining data for benchmarking

Strategy:

- Choosing 4 classes from the raw data folder:
- Represents a genus (no mixing, no non-plankton image, etc.)
- Every class contains similar amount of files

### Plankton classes to use in benchmarking

- Dinobryon
- Pseudonitzschia
- Dactyliosolen
- Corethron

### Exploratory data analysis

### Data preparation for modeling

| Resize | "Ensure fixed input size for model (e.g., 224Ã—224)" |
| Normalize | "Scale pixel values to [0, 1] or [-1, 1]" |
| Augmentation | Improve generalization and prevent overfitting |
| Train-test split | Evaluate properly on unseen data |
